#  OT-Muse

**Imagine it. Describe it. OT-Muse builds it — and lets your team build it together.**

OT-Muse is a collaborative AI world-building platform that transforms natural language prompts into rich, explorable digital worlds. Describe a world in your own words, and OT-Muse generates landscapes, animations, narrations, and interconnected lore — all from a single prompt. Then invite others to build alongside you in real time.

## What It Does

###  Create Worlds From Words

Type a prompt like *"A floating city above the clouds with crystal bridges and wind-powered engines"* — and OT-Muse generates an entire world: a detailed landscape image, an animated flyover, a narrated introduction, and a structured map of locations, characters, and artifacts. No design skills required.

###  Refine and Evolve

Worlds aren't static. Follow up with prompts like *"Add a dragon nesting above the northern tower"* and the world updates across all its assets — images, animations, narrations, and the world map all stay in sync. Every change is tracked in a visual history timeline, so you can always rewind.

###  Build Together in Real Time

Invite collaborators to join your world session via a shared link. Everyone sees changes as they happen — new elements appear, edits land instantly, and an activity feed keeps everyone in the loop. When two people edit the same thing, the AI steps in with smart compromise suggestions so no one's vision gets lost.

###  Explore Your Creation

Switch to Explore Mode and navigate your world interactively. Click a mountain to see what's on the other side. Enter a castle and discover its interior. Each step triggers new AI-generated scenes and narrations, turning your world from a static picture into a living, explorable space.

###  Export and Share

Download your world as a complete package — images, videos, audio, and a structured data file — ready for use in game engines, presentations, or storytelling tools. Or share a link so anyone can explore your world in their browser.
